==To Do Application

This application adds an example of AJAX to the To Do application built in Rails.  When a user presses the "Add a task" button, AJAX is used to show the form.  When the task is added, AJAX is used again to add the new task to the list and remove the form from view.

To see the application before AJAX was added, visit the [to-do-rails](https://github.com/epicodus-lessons/to-do-rails) in epicodus-lessons.
